# 🎰 Browser-Based JavaScript Slot Machine

## 📜 Description

This is a fully interactive, web-based Slot Machine game built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Originally inspired by a terminal-based Node.js tutorial, this project has been completely rebuilt to run directly in the browser using DOM manipulation and event listeners.

Players can deposit virtual money, choose how many lines to bet on, and spin a randomized 3x3 grid to win payouts based on symbol scarcity .

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive UI:** Replaced traditional command-line prompts with HTML inputs and clickable buttons .
- **Real-time Balance Tracking:** The game actively validates your funds, preventing you from betting more money than you have deposited .
- **Matrix Math Logic:** Uses complex JavaScript array manipulation (transposing vertical columns into horizontal rows) to calculate winning combinations .
- **Weighted Probabilities:** Not all symbols are equal! The spin mechanics use a mathematically accurate pool of symbols, meaning higher-paying symbols appear less frequently .
